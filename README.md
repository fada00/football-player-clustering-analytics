# ⚽ Football Player Role Identification & Clustering (WIP)

> ⚠️ **Status:** Work in Progress (Data Collection Complete)

### 🎯 Objective
To move beyond traditional position labels (Forward, Midfielder) and identify distinct **player roles** (e.g., Deep-lying Playmaker, Inverted Winger) using unsupervised machine learning on historical player data.

### 📂 Dataset
The project utilizes the `All_Players_1992-2025.csv` dataset, covering detailed performance metrics across major leagues for over 30 years.

### 🗺️ Roadmap
- [x] Data Collection & Cleaning
- [ ] Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on physical and technical attributes.
- [ ] Applying **K-Means Clustering** to segment players.
- [ ] Visualizing player evolution over decades.

### 🛠 Tools Planned
* Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
* Tableau / Matplotlib (Visualization)
